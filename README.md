## *Purpose*

A project to try out different data visualization techniques (chord diagrams, interactive scatter/histogram plots) and platforms (bokeh, plotly, datapane), using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/isaactaylorofficial/imdb-10000-most-voted-feature-films-041118) dataset, which catalogues details of popular movies.

## *Status*

7.3.2020 - I've gotten a lot more interactivity into the plots and got some of the plots I had made from other graphics libraries into one standalone [report](https://datapane.com/ryancahildebrandt/reports/movies_dashboard/?accesstoken=800edc196c07a9c18b4b031e709a596e8a0f8485) (*thanks Datapane!*) Next up, some analyses. What that means I have no idea at this moment.

5.24.2020 - This is very much a work in progress. Right now I'm working on building the interactivity of the plots in the project, as well as packaging them into a clean product.
