## *Purpose*

A project to try out different data visualization techniques (chord diagrams, interactive scatter/histogram plots) and platforms (bokeh, plotly, datapane), using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/isaactaylorofficial/imdb-10000-most-voted-feature-films-041118) dataset, which catalogues details of popular movies.

## *Status*

7.3.2020 - I've gotten a lot more interactivity into the plots and got the plots I had made from multiple graphics libraries into one standalone report (thanks Datapane!) Next up, some analyses. What that means I have no idea at this moment.



5.24.2020 - This is very much a work in progress. Right now I'm working on building the interactivity of the plots in the project, as well as packaging them into a clean product.
