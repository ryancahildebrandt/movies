A project to try out different data visualization techniques and platforms, using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/isaactaylorofficial/imdb-10000-most-voted-feature-films-041118) dataset, which catalogues details of popular movies.

## *Status*

This is very much a work in progress. Right now I'm working on building the interactivity of the plots in the project, as well as packaging them into a clean product.
